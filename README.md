# Quoter
Silly little discord bot i made for a discord server. Generates a funni image of a quote of a person, after someone quotes them in a channel

### Example
Someone says:

"I caca :sob:" - @coolusername

The bot will delete their message and send a cool image with the quota.

**To use the command, you need to change the line 76 in index.js to a user id of someone who can use it**
